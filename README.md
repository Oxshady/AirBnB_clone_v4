![AirBnB Logo](airbnb_logo.png)

## Project Overview

This project constitutes the initial phase of the AirBnB clone, focusing on backend development. It involves interfacing with a console application utilizing the cmd module in Python.

Data, represented as Python objects, are generated and stored in a JSON file, accessible via the json module in Python.

### Command Interpreter Description

The command interpreter resembles the Bash shell but offers a limited set of commands tailored for AirBnB website usage. Acting as the frontend of the web app, it facilitates interaction with the backend developed using Python's object-oriented programming.

Some available commands include:

- `show`
- `create`
- `update`
- `destroy`
- `count`

These commands enable various actions such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.
